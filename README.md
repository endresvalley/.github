If industry is motivated by profit, what counterbalance do we have?

We're a tiny team of devs (Lily, Anne & Fern) who motivate ourselves in breaking
(possibly even fixing) the problem in today's world-wide software collection. Too
many 'products' exist without clear benefits, promises, and ethics for the user.
It often feels as though the user *is the product*, used for AI training, being
spied on, advertised to, enrolled in subscriptions, the victim of enshittification, 
etc...

We refuse to follow in big tech's steps.

Our pain-points and frustrations with such software became a passion for spitefully
making quality, ethical, free and open source software.

We write software that is fair, accessible, welcoming to all, and unapologetic for 
doing *all of this* without the *profit motive*... just to prove a point! We hope
you enjoy our work as much as we do. 🩷
