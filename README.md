Hello!

You've stumbled upon the collaborative works of Ms. Valley and Ms. Endres (hence the name!) We're co-devs who spend our free time writing cool software that's practical, ethical, open source and focused on doing what's best for our users. Right now, we're focusing our energy on writing mobile apps (more details about that coming soon.)

Everything we write together is kept within this org.

Until there's more to share, farewell for now!
